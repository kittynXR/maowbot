# Help System Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the TUI help system to remove legacy command references and focus on the new gRPC-based command structure, supporting rapid evolution in preproduction.

## Changes Made

### 1. General Help (`help` command)
- **Reorganized** commands into logical categories:
  - Core Commands (help, status, list, quit)
  - User Management (user, credential)
  - Platform Management (platform, account, connection)
  - Content Management (command, redeem, config)
  - Platform-Specific (twitch, vrchat, drip)
  - System & Development (plugin, ai, diagnostics, system, test_harness, simulate)
- **Removed** all legacy command entries (autostart, start, stop, chat, member)
- **Removed** discord from platform-specific (not fully implemented)
- **Cleaner presentation** with better formatting and descriptions

### 2. Command Help Routing
- **Added redirects** for renamed commands:
  - `ttv` → "renamed to 'twitch'"
  - `plug` → "renamed to 'plugin'"
- **Added redirects** for merged commands:
  - `member` → "merged into 'user'"
  - `autostart`, `start`, `stop`, `chat` → "merged into 'connection'"
- **Organized** help lookups by category with clear comments
- **Removed** duplicate inline definitions for status, list, quit

### 3. Command Dispatcher Updates
- **Removed execution** of legacy commands in dispatcher
- **Added helpful redirect messages** instead of running deprecated commands
- **Consistent messaging** for all deprecated/renamed commands

### 4. Help Files Status
All new command help files are properly implemented:
- ✅ `help_unified_user.rs` - Comprehensive user management help
- ✅ `help_credential.rs` - Direct credential management help
- ✅ `help_connection.rs` - Unified connection management help
- ✅ `help_diagnostics.rs` - System diagnostics help
- ✅ `help_config.rs` - Enhanced config with export/import

## Benefits
1. **Clear migration path** - Users get helpful messages about renamed/merged commands
2. **No legacy baggage** - Help system only documents current commands
3. **Better organization** - Commands grouped logically by function
4. **Rapid evolution friendly** - Easy to update as commands change in preproduction
5. **Consistent experience** - All commands follow the same patterns

## User Experience
When users try old commands, they'll see:
```
> ttv
The 'ttv' command has been renamed to 'twitch'.
Use 'twitch' instead.

> member list
The 'member' command has been merged into 'user'.
Use 'user' for all user management functionality.

> start twitch
The 'start' command has been merged into 'connection'.
Use 'connection start' instead.
```

The help system now fully supports the new command structure and provides a clean, modern interface for users while maintaining helpful guidance for those familiar with the old commands.
