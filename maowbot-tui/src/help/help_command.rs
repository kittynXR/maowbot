Subcommands:

  command list [platform]
    Lists all known commands. If a platform is given, only that platformâ€™s commands are shown.
    Example: "command list twitch-irc"

  command setcooldown <commandName> <seconds> [platform]
    Sets the global cooldown (in seconds). During cooldown, re-use is blocked.
    Example: "command setcooldown !hello 5"

  command setwarnonce <commandName> <true|false> [platform]
    If set to true, the first user attempt during cooldown gets a warning. If false, no cooldown messages.

  command setrespond <commandName> <credentialId|username|none> [platform]
    Specifies the credential used for responding. E.g. if "myBotUser" is a known Twitch-IRC account,
    you can link the command to respond as that user. Use "none" to clear.

  command setplatform <commandName> <newPlatform> [oldPlatform]
    Moves a command from one platform to another. Defaults oldPlatform to "twitch-irc" if not specified.
    Example: "command setplatform !ping discord twitch-irc"

  command enable <commandName> [platform]
    Enables the specified command so it can be triggered.

  command disable <commandName> [platform]
    Disables the specified command.

Examples:
  command list
  command list twitch-irc
  command setcooldown !shout 10
