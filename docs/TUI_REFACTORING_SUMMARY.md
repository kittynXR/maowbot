# TUI Command Structure Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the TUI command structure to improve consistency, usability, and feature completeness as requested.

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Command Naming Consistency
- ✅ Renamed `ttv` → `twitch` (all files, functions, help text)
- ✅ Renamed `plug` → `plugin` 
- ✅ Updated all references in mod.rs, dispatch_grpc.rs, and help files

### 2. New Commands Created
- ✅ **credential**: Direct credential management (list, refresh, revoke, health, batch-refresh)
- ✅ **connection**: Consolidated connectivity commands (start, stop, autostart, status, chat)
- ✅ **diagnostics**: System health monitoring (health, status, metrics, logs, test)

### 3. Command Consolidation
- ✅ **user**: Unified user and member commands into single command with subcommands:
  - Basic ops: add, remove, edit, info, list, search
  - Extended ops: chat, note, merge, roles, analysis
- ✅ **config**: Enhanced with export/import functionality

### 4. Technical Implementation Details

#### New Adapter Files Created:
- `/home/kittyn/maowbot/maowbot-tui/src/commands/credential_adapter.rs`
- `/home/kittyn/maowbot/maowbot-tui/src/commands/connection_adapter.rs`
- `/home/kittyn/maowbot/maowbot-tui/src/commands/unified_user_adapter.rs`
- `/home/kittyn/maowbot/maowbot-tui/src/commands/diagnostics_adapter.rs`

#### Files Renamed:
- `ttv.rs` → `twitch.rs`
- `ttv_adapter.rs` → `twitch_adapter.rs`
- `ttv_simple_adapter.rs` → `twitch_simple_adapter.rs`
- `help_ttv.rs` → `help_twitch.rs`

#### Enhanced Files:
- `config_adapter.rs`: Added export/import with JSON serialization
- `dispatch_grpc.rs`: Updated to use new command structure

### 5. Features Added

#### Credential Command:
- List all credentials with expiry status
- Refresh individual or batch credentials
- Revoke credentials
- Health check with scoring
- Platform-specific filtering

#### Connection Command:
- Unified start/stop/autostart functionality
- Runtime status monitoring
- Chat message sending
- Platform runtime management

#### Diagnostics Command:
- System health overview
- Plugin status monitoring
- Credential health scoring
- Runtime statistics
- Connectivity testing

#### Config Export/Import:
- JSON format with versioning
- Merge mode for safe imports
- Backup/restore capability

### 6. Proto Compatibility
All implementations correctly use the gRPC service definitions from maowbot-proto:
- Proper field names and types
- Correct request/response structures
- Appropriate error handling

### 7. Build Status
✅ All code now compiles successfully with only minor warnings (unused imports)

## Task Completion Status
1. ✅ Rename ttv to twitch
2. ✅ Rename plug to plugin  
3. ✅ Create credential command
4. ✅ Create connection command (consolidating connectivity)
5. ✅ Merge user and member commands
6. ✅ Add diagnostics command
7. ✅ Enhance config with export/import
8. ⏸️ Migrate simulate and test_harness to gRPC (low priority, not implemented)

## Next Steps
The TUI command structure is now more consistent and feature-complete. The remaining task (migrate simulate/test_harness) was marked as low priority and can be addressed separately if needed.
